  This survey, for the redefining of property lines between Subdivision Lots, included a boundary survey and topographic mapping of two adjoining properties. It included locating property lines, utilities, structures, and right-of-way for NE 108th Avenue and NE Russell Street within the Portland, Oregon City limits. </p> 
    <p><strong>Discount Tire of Tigard</strong> <br />

    <p><strong>Crossroads Church of Portland</strong><br />
    A boundary survey and topographic mapping of the parking area, utilities, trees, buildings, and right-of-way for I- 205 and NE 102nd Avenue. This survey was for the design and construction of an addition to the church, school, parking lot, and community food bank. Bluedot Group also provided construction staking support to the contractor.</p> 
    <p><strong>Multnomah Presbyterian Church of Beaverton</strong><br />

       <div class="CollapsiblePanelContent"><p><strong>Information on land surveying and mapping for<br />our private sector clients</strong><br /> 
    Bluedot has extensive experience performing boundary, topographic, and ALTA Surveys for private sector clients. Typical work includes research into public records, liaison with public agencies and utility companies, comprehensive field work, professional analysis of the data, and detailed mapping and reporting of findings.</p> 
    <p>Topographic Maps detail the extent and location of improvements on the land usually combined with the roll of the land itself. This “roll of the land” is often expressed in the form of contours. Underground features, such as storm drains, sanitary sewers, water and natural gas lines, and cable ducts may also be included. Mapping of this kind is essential to architects and engineers seeking to design new improvements or additions to existing ones.</p> 
    <p>The laws of the State of Oregon require that every boundary survey be memorialized by a map, known as a “Record of Survey”, and that the map be filed in the records of the appropriate County Surveyor. Such maps also serve the purpose of making your survey part of the public record, giving your neighbors constructive notice of the location of your property lines. The filing of a “Record of Survey” map greatly reduces the chance of future boundary disputes and facilitates the restoration of property boundary monuments, if such monuments become lost or destroyed.  Every boundary survey begins with a check of the County Surveyors’ cache of Records of Survey from years gone by. In some areas the record goes back to the earliest pioneer times.</p> 
    <p>An “ALTA Survey” is one performed in accordance with standards agreed to by the American Land Title Association and the National Society of Professional Surveyors. These standards specify the elements which the Surveyor will include on the map and the degree of accuracy to which they will be located. The standards also assign certain responsibilities of disclosure to the owner of the property under consideration. ALTA Surveys are typically requested by mortgage lenders on commercial properties.</p> 
    <p>The current ALTA Survey standards, approved in 2005, are available at <a href="http://www.nspsmo.org/_data/global/images/ALTA2005.pdf" target="_blank">www.nspsmo.org</a> and at <a href="http://www.alta.org/publications/99alta.pdf" target="_blank">www.alta.org</a>.</p> 
    <p>Subdivisions Plats are maps that are used to divide property into new lots. A Partition Plat is a specific kind of Subdivision Map, one that creates 3 or less lots.  The approval process for subdivisions usually requires the surveyor to work in close cooperation with a planner, an architect, a civil engineer, and perhaps other consultants.</p></div></div>
