    </strong>The Oregon Department of Transportation has hired Bluedot for numerous projects. In each case the work was performed to exacting ODOT standards. Work assignments typically include establishment of survey control on a geodetic datum, pre-design topographic base mapping, recovery of monuments and resolution of the highway right-of-way, preparation of right-of-way strip maps and legal descriptions for property acquisition, and filing pre- and post-construction Records of Survey. Final products are delivered in the ODOT preferred Microstation and Inroads environments.</p>
